# Welcome to My Personal Page  

## About Me  
I am a researcher interested in **machine learning for computational catalysis**, focusing on integrating **machine learning** with **first-principles simulations** to accelerate materials discovery. My work spans:  

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT) & Molecular Dynamics (MD)** for catalytic systems  
- **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs)** to model complex chemical environments  
- **Spectroscopic Data Analysis and Modeling** for materials characterization  
- **Automated Workflows** for high-throughput data generation and processing
